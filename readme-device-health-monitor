# Device Health Monitoring System (C++)

## Description
A C++ console application that simulates basic health monitoring
for an embedded device by checking temperature and voltage levels.

## Features
- Threshold-based monitoring
- Warning generation for abnormal conditions
- Object-Oriented design

## Concepts Used
- C++ classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Conditional logic
- Console I/O

## How to Run
g++ device_monitor.cpp -o device_monitor
./device_monitor

## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates system monitoring logic commonly used in
embedded and medical device software.
